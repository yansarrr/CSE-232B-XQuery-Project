        <LINE>Have you not made an universal shout,</LINE>
        
        <LINE>That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,</LINE>
        
        <LINE>To hear the replication of your sounds</LINE>

        <LINE>Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now</LINE>

        <LINE>Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'</LINE>
        
        <LINE>I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,</LINE>
        
        <LINE>Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder</LINE>
        
        <LINE>The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber</LINE>
        
        <LINE>Did I the tired Caesar. And this man</LINE>
        
        <LINE>Is now become a god, and Cassius is</LINE>
        
        <LINE>A wretched creature and must bend his body,</LINE>

        <LINE>He had a fever when he was in Spain,</LINE>

        <LINE>His coward lips did from their colour fly,</LINE>

        <LINE>Mark him and write his speeches in their books,</LINE>
        
        <LINE>Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'</LINE>

        <LINE>I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:</LINE>
        
        <LINE>it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark</LINE>
        
        <LINE>Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown</LINE>
        
        <LINE>neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told</LINE>
        
        <LINE>you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my</LINE>
        
        <LINE>thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he</LINE>
        
        <LINE>offered it to him again; then he put it by again:</LINE>
        
        <LINE>but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his</LINE>
        
        <LINE>fingers off it. And then he offered it the third</LINE>
        
        <LINE>time; he put it the third time by: and still as he</LINE>
        
        <LINE>refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their</LINE>
        
        <LINE>chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps</LINE>
        
        <LINE>and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because</LINE>
        
        <LINE>Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked</LINE>
        
        <LINE>Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and</LINE>

        <LINE>--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved</LINE>
        
        <LINE>Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and</LINE>

        <LINE>fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his</LINE>
